# CNN_Mech_Parts
A deep learning project for classifying mechanical parts. Inspired by Promechs original work and using Mechanical Classification Benchmark dataset

### Related Work

This is a project that is inspired by Sunny Tuladhar work of making a CNN to classify mechanical parts. I just took interest and improved the original code and model to have the same precision, but working with more classes while also adding some QOL changes to make it easier to keep track of all logs and plots.

### CNN Architecture

Very simple architecture, similar to AlexNet. We are going to use 224x224 grey scaled images to feed it. There is a code snippet to extract 8 screenchots of 3D models. The original database was [MCB dataset B](https://mechanical-components.herokuapp.com/)
